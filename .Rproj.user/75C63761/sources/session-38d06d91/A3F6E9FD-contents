I am a research associate at the [Chair of International Economics at TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/vwl/iwb#). I graduated from the development economics masterâ€™s program at GSID Nagoya University in Japan. My research interests include convergence, machine learning applications, economic growth, remote sensing, trade, and spatial econometrics. I also studied a 5-year physics BSc at the National University of Colombia. Other research interests include areas of socio/econ-physics, such as opinion dynamics, applications of statistical mechanics, and network theory. Moreover, I cofounded the [QuaRCS lab](https://quarcs-lab.org/).
