Abstract

Homicide rates are forecasted for 1120 inland municipalities in
Colombia. Using data from 2003 to 2018, five different forecasting methods
are used: ETS, ARIMA, STAR, a classical beta convergence based model and
a spatial beta convergence model. Time series cross validation for 4-year ahead
forecasts is implemented to assess the accuracy of all models. It is found that
the STAR and the beta models have the lowest root mean squared errors.
Given the highest forecasting accuracy for the spatial beta model, municipal
homicide rates are forecasted for the year 2022 and compared with the National
SDG target in the Colombian National Development plan. Lastly, exploratory
spatial analysis shows that regions that are likely to accomplish the target are
geographically clustered and the same for regions that are forecasted to lag
behind. Therefore, as time goes by, space appears to play a more important
role in the evolution of homicide rates. The paper concludes with some policy
implications in terms of spatial eects and the mitigation of crime.
