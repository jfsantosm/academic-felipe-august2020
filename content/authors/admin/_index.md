I currently work as a research assistant at the Chair of International Economics at TU Dresden. I have graduated from the Development Economics Masterâ€™s degree at GSID Nagoya University in Japan. In the DevEcon field am interested in research related to:  convergence, applications of machine learning, economic growth and spatial econometrics. I also studied a BSc in Physics and my research interests include areas of Sociophysics such as: opinion dynamics, applications of statistical mechanics and network theory. Moreover, am a cofounder of the QuaRCS lab.
