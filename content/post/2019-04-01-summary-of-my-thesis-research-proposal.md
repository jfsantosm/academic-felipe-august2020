Am currently enrolled in the master’s degree in International development at Nagoya University under the supervision of professor Carlos Mendez and am planning to apply after finishing this course to the PhD at the same university. My main aim is to research on inequality and relate such research with policy evaluation and the accomplishment of Sustainable Development Goals.

Inland Colombia has in total 32 states including the Capital Bogota, it is a country rich in resources such as Gold and Oil, however is still a developing country and lags behind in many indicators of human development; for example, poverty and income inequality are high for South American averages. Colombia as many other countries around the world is committed to develop and has planned to accomplish as much as feasible the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

This study will start by selecting around 10 indexes that are related to the SDGs; for example by taking into consideration poverty, health, income inequality, gender in equality, among others. In principle these indexes will be collected for each of the 32 states in Colombia and hopefully from 1980 onwards if possible, up to the latest data available (around 2015-2019).

After collecting this data on all indexes, I plan to study the evolution of regions across time and space. For this purpose Econometric Spatial Statistics will be used. I will explain as follows what these Econometric methods mean.

The main idea is to find if there has been some type of convergence across regions in Colombia, this will answer the question: Are all regions in Colombia converging to certain development outcome? If not, which regions are and are not? Colombia has a few rich states including the capital and some other peripheric and mostly poor states, however, is possible that poor states develop at a faster rate so that in the future they can converge and reach the state of development of the most advanced states. 

By doing this spatial analysis it may also be found the influence of neigboring states, in the sense that rich states may make neighbor states richer and unfortunately the opposite may happen too, that poorer states restrain the development of other close states. This will be analyzed for each of the states and for each of the 10 indexes. 

On one hand, some other interesting correlation between indexes may be found, for example that education (related to the 4 SDG) may be positively correlated with gender equality (related to the 5 SDG) which means that as states attain better education also at the same time the also improve the gender equality indicators. This is just an example but such correlation may be found for several combinations of indexes across different states and different years.

On the other hand, having data for several years across regions and by using certain econometric methods is possible to forecast the development of all regions. This forecasting will suggest which regions will likely accomplish the SDGs related to the indexes chosen. In few words, it will give a partial answer to the questions: Is Colombia developing? Will it accomplish some of the SDGs?

A last part of this research will be focused on a practical application. This year the current president of Colombia Ivan Duque has released the latest “2018 2022 National Development Plan” which is a plan which sets the route of development for Colombia, a 1500 pages document in which among many other topics, it explicitly sets goals for the SDGs in the short and long term.

The analysis of the evolution of the indexes (and their forecastings) will be compared with the goals and plans set in the “2018-2022 National Development Plan”, it may be found that the goals set in such plan  differ from the pattern forecasted using econometric methods. By analyzing these differences, it may be possible to suggest policy changes in order to accomplish some of the SDGs.
